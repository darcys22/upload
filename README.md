This script takes a post you write and uploads it to your webserver.

Simply put it in you local bin folder, make a post with the filename "blog" then type upload.

You need to change the script to your own username@webserver and create the keys so you don't need a password.

Similarly you need to change the SSH heredoc so it executes the benjen executable on your webserver.
